### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
---

I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer based in Orlando, FL dedicated to creating web development applications and building scalable, efficient programs. I am most proficient, and drawn to, Python at the moment - with JavaScript/React as my next strongest language. I am a recent Flatiron School alumni where I completed the Full-Stack Software Engineering program. My previous career was in technical sales and leadership within the commercial construction industry. Now, I'm super excited to break into the Tech world and continue the journey towards becoming a software engineer. 

Thanks for stopping by and looking at my work!!

* âš¡ Fun fact: I was born with 11 fingers. Although I currently only have 10 per the status quo.
